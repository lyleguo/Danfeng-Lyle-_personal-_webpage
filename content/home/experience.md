        Aspect-controlled referring expression generation using prompt
        * Design a referring expression generation model and its aspects of generation can be controlled. It achieves 1.08 CIDEr score.
        * Apply referring expression generation model for downstream datasets augmentation. Existing models trained with our synthetic data have accuracy close to the cases where they use real data.
